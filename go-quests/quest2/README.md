# Moral of the Fable
* Better off when having some extent of understanding of handler and handlerFunc. [read more](https://www.alexedwards.net/blog/a-recap-of-request-handling)
* The 2 functions to be implemented in this task actually embodiment a concept: http.Handler wrapper. [read more](https://medium.com/@matryer/the-http-handler-wrapper-technique-in-golang-updated-bc7fbcffa702)
* If you try to create slice with make, the length is required.
* Most common way to read and write to file: ioutil.ReadFile/ioutil.WriteFile. [example](https://tutorialedge.net/golang/reading-writing-files-in-go/)
* Command line flags [example](https://gobyexample.com/command-line-flags). You can type `./project-name -help` to show all the available flags in case you forgot what you've declared in the code :)
* Another [example](https://golangbot.com/read-files/) that uses read file and flag together.
